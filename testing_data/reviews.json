I used a tiny bit and just ate the burger. They ended up charging me $3.00 for the extra mayo! I know sometimes it’s an up charge but I would have preferred to have been told that before I received it.",

I asked for medium rare prime rib and got rare prime rib and it was cold. Any requests for fresh mint or AF drinks was automatically a NO. Will not go there again.",
